# Client Acceptance Test Environment (CATE)

The Sign In Canada client acceptance test environment is available to anyone in
the GC who wishes to:

* Learn how to use OpenID Connect to integrate with Sign In Canada
* Develop and test new digital service delivery applications

Integrating a sandbox, development, or test environment to Sign In Canada is fast, and
easy. Simply send an email to <Signin-AuthentiCanada@tbs-sct.gc.ca> with some
basic information about your application such as the cloud service or
development platform are you using. The Sign In Canada team will help you get
your application connected and working, often within one or two days.
