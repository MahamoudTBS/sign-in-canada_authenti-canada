## General Service Definition


Sign in Canada is an online service that provides a secure and easy way to access multiple government programs and services. With the help of a credential like GCkey or a bank partner, Sign in Canada's Multi-Factor Authentication (SIC MFA) service lets you securely sign into government agencies' services.

The service is designed to make it easier and more secure for you to manage federal benefits, services, and applications. Sign in Canada works with other federal agencies (called "relying parties") to give you access to their services.

Sign in Canada takes security seriously and uses strong measures to protect your account. The service also respects your privacy by collecting only the necessary information from you and sharing it only with the relying parties that need it to give you access to their service.

## We collect your personal information

Your personal information includes your phone number. Information is collected only for the purpose of issuing and managing access to Government of Canada systems and applications and provide you with necessary communications. If you do not wish to use a phone number to access electronic services, you may apply for the service by phone, fax, mail, or in person.

For further details, refer to the corresponding relying party’s service contact information.

The personal information collected and used for signing up into a service is stored in Personal Information Bank PCU 607. This personal information will be retained for at least two years.
