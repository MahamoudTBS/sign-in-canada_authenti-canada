# Announcements

## July 31st, 2023

In order to ensure prioritization of an enterprise [Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM)](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/customer-identity-access-management-ciam) Software as a Service (SaaS) solution, the Sign In Canada (SIC) service is entering a maintenance phase. As a result, there will be no new enhancements to or integrations with the **SIC Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**. 

The service will continue to operate with current support levels for existing integrations and clients.  Any updates will be limited to bug fixes and security patches.  This means that no new applications will be onboarded to the SIC MVP.

All prospective customers will need to leverage the **Shared Services Canada (SSC) Government of Canada Credential Federation (GCCF)** consolidator service until the enterprise CIAM solution is in place. The CIAM SaaS contract is targeted to be awarded in spring of 2024 with departmental specific solutions planned to be integrated afterwards.

Existing SIC clients will be migrated onto the new CIAM solution once it has been procured and deployed. Please rest assured that we will provide additional details on the status of the CIAM procurement along with migration plans when more specific information is available.

Please contact the **SSC External Credential Management (ECM) mailbox** (ecm-gje@ssc-spc.gc.ca) for additional information about the GCCF consolidator service.

If you have any questions or concerns, or would like additional information about the CIAM procurement, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to the [Sign In Canada](mailto:SignIn-AuthentiCanada@tbs-sct.gc.ca) mailbox.
