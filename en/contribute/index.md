## How to Contribute

When contributing, post comments and discuss changes you wish to make via [Issues](https://github.com/sign-in-canada/Acceptance-Platform/issues).

Feel free to propose changes by creating Pull Requests. If you don't have write access, editing a file will create a Fork of this project for you to save your proposed changes to. Submitting a change to a file will write it to a new Branch in your Fork, so you can send a Pull Request.

If this is your first time contributing on GitHub, don't worry! Let us know if you have any questions.

### Security

**Do not post any security issues on the public repository!** See [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/sign-in-canada/Acceptance-Platform/blob/main/SECURITY.md)
