<h2 id="general-service-definition">General Service Definition</h2>

<p>Sign in Canada is an online service that provides a secure and easy way to access multiple government programs and services. With the help of a credential like GCkey or a bank partner, Sign in Canada‚Äôs Multi-Factor Authentication (SIC MFA) service lets you securely sign into government agencies‚Äô services.</p>

<p>The service is designed to make it easier and more secure for you to manage federal benefits, services, and applications. Sign in Canada works with other federal agencies (called ‚Äúrelying parties‚Äù) to give you access to their services.</p>

<p>Sign in Canada takes security seriously and uses strong measures to protect your account. The service also respects your privacy by collecting only the necessary information from you and sharing it only with the relying parties that need it to give you access to their service.</p>
