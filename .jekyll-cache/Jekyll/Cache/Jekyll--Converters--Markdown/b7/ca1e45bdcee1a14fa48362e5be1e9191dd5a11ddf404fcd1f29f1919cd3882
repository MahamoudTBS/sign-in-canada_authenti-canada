<details>

<summary>Why am I being asked to set up a â€˜second stepâ€™?</summary>

Two step verification is an extra layer of security that requires a code in addition to your password to access your account. This code can be sent to your phone or generated by the authenticator app. 

Think of it like a locked door that can only be opened with both a key and a secret code. Someone pretending to be you on the internet should never be able to get both the key and the code.

<details>
<summary>What do you do with my information?</summary>

Your phone number will be used to:
- Send you codes to help verify itâ€™s you signing in each time
- Notify you of any changes made to your sign in settings.

Your phone number will be stored securely.

For more information, see the full [privacy notice statement]().

<details>
<summary>What is an authenticator app?</summary>

An authenticator app is a tool that helps keep your online account safe. Every time you sign in, the app will give you a new code you will need to enter to prove it's you signing in. This is more secure than using your mobile phone number to receive a one-time code.

You can download or use a third-party app of your choice. You only need to download it to one device.

<summary>What if I lose my phone or phone number?</summary>

If you set up a phone number as your two-step verification and have added a second, backup phone number, you can:

- Select the â€˜Try another methodâ€™ link on the screen you would have received your code.
- Select your backup phone number to send another code
- Enter the code sent to your other phone
- Sign in

If you set up a phone number as your two step verification and did not add a second, backup phone number and you have lost access to your phone number, unfortunately there is no way to recover your account. You will have to create a new account.
