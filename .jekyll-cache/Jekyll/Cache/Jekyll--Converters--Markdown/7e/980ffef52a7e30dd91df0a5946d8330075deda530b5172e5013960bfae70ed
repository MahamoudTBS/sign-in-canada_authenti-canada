<p>When contributing, post comments and discuss changes you wish to make via <a href="https://github.com/sign-in-canada/Acceptance-Platform/issues">Issues</a>.</p>

<p>Feel free to propose changes by creating Pull Requests. If you don’t have write access, editing a file will create a Fork of this project for you to save your proposed changes to. Submitting a change to a file will write it to a new Branch in your Fork, so you can send a Pull Request.</p>

<p>If this is your first time contributing on GitHub, don’t worry! Let us know if you have any questions.</p>
